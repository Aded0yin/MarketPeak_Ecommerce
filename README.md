## Capstone Project: E-commerce Platform Deployment with Git, Linux, and AWS

**Project Instructions**

In this project I will be developing an e-commerce website for a new online marketplace named "MarketPeak." This platform will feature product listings, a shopping cart, and user authentication. I will implement this project by using Git for version control, i will develop the platform in a Linux environment, and deploy it on an AWS EC2 instance.

## Tasks 1: Implement Version Control with Git

**1.1.  Initialize Git Repository:** Create the project directory and name it "MarketPeak_Ecommerce". then cd into the new project directory and initialize a git repository.

```markdown
mkdir MarketPeak_Ecommerce
cd MarketPeak_Ecommerce
git init
```

**1.2. Obtain and Prepare the E-Commerce Website Template:** 
Instead of developing the website from scratch, I used a pre-existing e-commerce website template as the actual website is usually done by web/software developers.
