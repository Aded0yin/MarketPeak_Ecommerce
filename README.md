## Capstone Project: E-commerce Platform Deployment with Git, Linux, and AWS

**Project Instructions**

In this project I will be developing an e-commerce website for a new online marketplace named "MarketPeak." This platform will feature product listings, a shopping cart, and user authentication. I will implement this project by using Git for version control, i will develop the platform in a Linux environment, and deploy it on an AWS EC2 instance.

## Tasks 1: Implement Version Control with Git

**1.1.  Initialize Git Repository:** Create the project directory and name it "MarketPeak_Ecommerce". then cd into the new project directory and initialize a git repository.

```markdown
mkdir MarketPeak_Ecommerce
cd MarketPeak_Ecommerce
git init
```

**1.2. Obtain and Prepare the E-Commerce Website Template:** 
Instead of developing the website from scratch, I used a pre-existing e-commerce website template as the actual website is usually done by web/software developers.

**1.3 Download a Website Template:** Visit (Tooplate)[https://www.tooplate.com/] or any other free template resource. Look for templates that are ready to use and require minimal adjustments.

**1.4 Prepare the Website Template:** Extract the downloaded template into your project directory, MarketPeak_Ecommerce

**1.5 Stage and Commit the Template to Git:** I added the website files, setup Git configuration, and commit the changes to the MarketPeak_Ecommerce Git repository with the command

```
git add .
git config --global user.name "YourUsername"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
git commit -m "Initial commit with basic e-commerce site structure"
```
